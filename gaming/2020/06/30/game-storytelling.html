        <!-- <h1 class="post-title">Storytelling in Games, Pt. 1</h1> -->

        <section class="post-content">
            <p>I had an interesting experience recently while showing my wife The Last of Us 2. We had just come off her watching me play through Death Stranding, which was the first game she’d watched me play and really the first modern game she had been made aware of. Prior to this, she had the usual notion that games were largely brainless excuses to shoot zombies, play sports, and generally partake in dynamic but meaningless activities. And she wasn’t 100% incorrect.</p>

<p>Anyway. I notice that as I’m playing TLOU2, there are some parts of the game that hold her interest easily - specifically, all of the emotion-heavy moments in the beginning of the game when the plot is getting set up and there’s a lot of key cinematics and dialog. And then her focus wanes.</p>

<p>A pretty long section of sneaking around and killing infected comes up. I have to plow through 30 minutes of methodically killing around a dozen enemies. Then there’s some awkward moments where I have to randomly scrounge around for supplies and craft some items even though it doesn’t really make sense in the current context of this character’s situation. My wife is taken completely out of the immersion.</p>

<p>I realize that as a lifelong gamer, I’ve built up mental callouses to these gamey segments and know them for what they are, but have to kind of apologetically explain them away to my wife as I play as to why the game is the way it is. Which isn’t to take away anything from TLOU2 - it’s pretty fantastic - it’s more a symptom of the medium at large.</p>

<p>My wife is by all accounts a cinephile and bookworm. Definitely somebody who invests herself in a good story. But in a demographic the game industry has yet to attract.</p>

<h2 id="interactive-storytelling">Interactive storytelling</h2>

<p>Games let you play <em>as</em> the character, wouldn’t this obviously be the most effective way to experience a story and communicate empathy to the player?</p>

<p>Well, yes and no. There’s a few problems with this. The main problem is that, as a player, the number of actions and interactions with the world, in a fully-dynamic perspective, are limited. You’re usually limited to explicit actions like movement, picking things up, shooting guns, manipulating levers, and so forth.</p>

<p>This means that it’s quite doable for games to communicate explosive action scenes in a dynamic, emergent way, because your interaction with the world, as the player, only needs to consist of things like running, taking cover, and shooting.</p>

<p>But what if you wanted an interactive scene with two people having a conversation at a dinner table? Are you going to make controls for doing everything the person might do during that conversation? And what about the dialog itself? Of course all of this has to be scripted.</p>

<p>On top of this, interactivity is a double-edged sword. You trade directorial control (composition, timing, frame-by-frame minutae) for player agency. Sometimes this trade-off is worth it and sometimes it isn’t. A good example of an extreme of this approach is Half-Life, where the player experiences everything from the perspective of Gordon Freeman and there are no cuts or any sense of a disembodied camera. While this does work on some level, it also results in an abnormally mute and kind of power-less main character - you have the ability to mow down hundreds of headcrabs, but you can’t even have a basic social interaction with somebody that doesn’t consist of them monologuing exposition at you.</p>

<h2 id="the-bias-towards-action">The bias towards action</h2>

<p>With the above in mind, we can conclude that most games have no choice but to heavily rely on extrinsic events happening to advance the plot which the player can participate in. There are games which have explored more “inner monologue” type stories which manifest themselves physically in the game world, such as Alan Wake, but even these tend to fall back on familiar patterns of interaction with the world: movement, shooting, collecting.</p>

<p>One of my favorite styles of movie can be described as “slow cinema”, which typically features languid, surreal imagery and evokes a melancholic mood. Perhaps not a single definable event happens during the whole film. Plot, or the lack of it, is expressed in stunted, subtle interactions. It’s all about the little touch, the nudge, the hesitation of the camera.</p>

<p>A contemporary game would take a huge risk employing this method of storytelling. The lack of player agency, the difficulty in allowing the player to have meaningful interaction in a world where over-the-top action does not fit…it’s a hard problem. Do you just put the whole thing on rails? How would you approach this? A typical gamer would not find anything “fun” about a setup with no enemies to kill, no overt puzzles to solve.</p>

<p>Maybe I’m coming off as elitist, but I don’t mean to be. I genuinely want games to move on from where they’re at, and I think I’m not alone in this sentiment. There has been a lot of change recently in the game industry regarding concepts like cinematic storytelling which I’d like to explore in future posts.</p>
